WARNING: The  information  in  this man page is an extract from the full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and  is  limited to the meaning of the options. This  man  page  is not kept up to date except when volunteers want to maintain it.   If  you  find  a  discrepancy between  the  man  page and the software, please check the Info file, which is the authoritative documentation. If we find that the things in this man page that  are  out of date cause significant confusion or complaints, we will stop distributing the man page.  The alternative, updating the  man  page when we update the Info file, is impossible because the rest of the work of maintaining GNU CC  leaves us no time for that.  The GNU project regards man pages as obsolete and should not let them take time away from other things. For  complete and current documentation, refer to the Info file `gcc' or the manual Using and  Porting  GNU  CC  (for version  2.0).  Both are made from the Texinfo source file gcc.texinfo.
